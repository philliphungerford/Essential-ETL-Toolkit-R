# Essential-ETL-Toolkit-R
This is a toolkit that shows the most useful functions I have needed when making an ETL in R. 

The code is broken down into three sections:
1. Extract - functions and tools needed to extract data from db or excel files 
2. Transform - functions and tools needed to transform the data into a useful way
3. Load - functions and tools needed to load data to databases or write to excel / csv
